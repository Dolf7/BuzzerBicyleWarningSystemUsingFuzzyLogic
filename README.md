# Buzzer Bicyle Warning System Using Fuzzy Logic

System crated for warning system on electric bike. Controlled by Arduino Uno microcontroller. Arduino will take 2 input from 
- HCSR-04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Infrared Module

HCSR-04 used for to take calculate nearest distance from object ahead of bicycle and Infrared Module used for calculate the speed of the bicycle

So, the input parameter for the system is Distance object ahead and Speed of the bicyle

System using this schematic
